        In a medium bowl, mix together the spinach, shallot, green onions, and artichokes with the Greek yogurt, mayonnaise, Parmesan cheese, dried dill, garlic powder, salt and pepper. Taste and add a few pinches kosher salt if desired.

    <div>Steps: Preheat the oven to 375°F. Place the brie in a baking dish or on a parchment-lined baking sheet. Bake for 15 minutes until soft and warm: it’s done when you touch the center with your finger and it feels very liquid inside.
